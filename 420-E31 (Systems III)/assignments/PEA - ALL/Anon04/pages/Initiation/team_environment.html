			Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) is the department in Government of Canada responsible for meeting the Canada's
			legal obligations and commitments to Aboriginal peoples. INAC is also responsible for fulfilling the federal government's
			constitutional responsibilities in the North. I worked as part of Innovation, information and Technology branch. The Innovation,
			Information and Technology branch provides information and different services to the Department. This branch is responsible
			for development of many financial and database applications used within and outside of the department.

			Our workplace was separated by cubicles. Each cubicle was shared by only one person. My workplace included a windows 7 machine
			with the required development software and IDEs. Through my daily tasks, I worked with Visual Studio 2015 and PLSQL Developer
			(Not an Oracle product) to write database queries or maintain database procedure. TFMS is written in Visual Basic and
			currently they are in process of upgrading the application to newer technologies such as C# with newer version of .NET
			and MVC framework.
		</p>

		<h3>Skills acquired</h3>
		<p>
			My lessons in Web Programming and Programming both helped me prepare for my daily tasks. My skills in debugging were some
			of the most important technics I’ve learned at school that helped to be prepared for any bug and issues that were found
			assigned to me. In addition to my current set of skills, I had to learn how to work with test track pro in order to be
			able to manage different tasks and bugs. I familiarized myself with MVC architecture and CSLA framework and learned implementation
			of these technologies on backend of project. Inter personal skills learnt in mocking interviews with the clients at school
			also helped me to communicate more effectively and resolve clients issues faster in client meeting sessions.
		</p>

		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>
			I think students are well prepared for their co-op term. However, understanding the software development process in an enterprise
			environment in advance would help students to understand the organization faster and easier.
		</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
			In conclusion, it was a great experience working for Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) as a student developer;
			I’ve learned to work with different languages and in a different programming environment. Definitely these new set of
			skills will help me with my future studies and career.
