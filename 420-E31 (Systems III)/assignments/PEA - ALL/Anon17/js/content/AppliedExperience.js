        <h3>Evaluation:</h3>
            <p>My experience with this co-op placement has been excellent.  Working with my manager and with this team has been and continues to be a wonderful experience.  From the very beginning everyone here has been friendly and supportive of my efforts to learn the project environment and contribute to it. Even the workplace’s accommodation of my ADHD disability has been extraordinary.  Every day I look forward to the work challenges that I encounter.</p>
            <p>My training at Heritage has left me very well prepared for this work environment with only one exception.  We had been trained in the MVC pattern.  However this did not prepare me to understand the differences between that and the Visual Studio MVC template (which is something that we learn in semester five). That said the learning environment at Heritage left me well prepared to adapt and learn what I needed for the project on hand very quickly.</p>
            <p>Even though it is very early in the co-op work term, there have already been so many positive experiences to highlight, both in my preparedness from training and in the work environment itself.</p>  
            <p>From my training preparation perspective, Heritage taught me all about different System Development Life Cycles and how to make a presentation. In my first week here, I was asked to put together a presentation of the Agile methodology and how to implement it.  Using notes from school and tools that I learned in class like Lucidchart and Presi I was able to put something together in about three hours that really impressed the team.</p>
            <p>From a work environment perspective my experiences here have been simply incredible.  My manager, Lisa Hyde, has been on the ball in every way since my very first interview with her.  I had casually mentioned during the interview about the incredible accommodations Heritage had made in regard to my ADHD and allowing me to rest on Thursdays. Much to my surprise Lisa had already made the same accommodation for me at work!  She made sure that all the security paper work was in order and processed in a timely manner so that I could work right away and made sure that the work station was set up with what I needed.  When I casually mentioned that I could use a second monitor but the waiting list was about a year, she gave me her own!</p>
            <p>The team I am working with are also incredible.  They have been extremely supportive of my efforts to learn the project and work environment.  They have taught me new skills in programming organisation and readability while at the same time encouraging my creative contributions. It is wonderful to interact with such an intelligent and friendly group of people.</p>
            <p>My major contribution to the team was a project of my own creation.  It reduced the time required to develop applications.  Normally it would take a team member between 1 to 2 weeks per flowchart to complete and a typical application would have between 5 – 50 flowcharts.  My project reduced this time to one to two hours per flowchart and prevented a number of common errors from occurring.  The team was very happy to receive this project as it made the work a lot easier and made them look fantastic.</p>
            <p>Considering how well Heritage has prepared me for the co-op work experience there is only one thing I can think off that could have been done to make me better prepared. I think a brief introduction to Visual Studio MVC and how it is different from the pattern MVC would make a critical difference.  I feel that this should be done before co-op interviews start so that students can give intelligent answers to interviewers. Considering what I know now and looking back at those interviews I think there might have been some confusion that could have been avoided when I was asked “Do you know MVC?”</p>
            <p>For the co-op work term, everything has been such a wonderful experience that I cannot imagine anything that could improve it. This has been the best job I’ve ever had and I fully intend to stay on after I graduate.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>	My experiences at Heritage and my co-op placement at ESDC have been so positive that I find it difficult to express how wonderful it all is.  When I go home, I actually get excited about the work I get to do the next day. When I think about all the hard work my teachers have put into the classes and what they taught me I feel extremely grateful and look forward to my third year at Heritage.  I am especially grateful to Sandra Stark for the hard work she put into managing the co-op interviews and placements.  Without her and her attention to detail I would not have been nearly as well prepared for the work environment as I am.</p>
