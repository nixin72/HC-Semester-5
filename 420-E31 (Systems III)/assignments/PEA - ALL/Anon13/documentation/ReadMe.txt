Color Choice: The color choice was chosen to be simple and make the banner and content of the page stand out. The white for the banner as that is what i would consider to be the most important part of the pages as it is your access to every other page. Dark background and light background for the content as it makes the content pop out to the reader. The actual colors were chosen because they work well together and don't seem to out of match.



Banner Choice:
I chose a simple banner with a logo and navigation as i want to make the content be the big attraction of every page as the purpose of the website is to be informative of what you've learned over the years. the part of the banner separate is just under the nav aspect and is there to inform the reader of the project and other information of the school and year. Gives context to the purpose of the web page.
